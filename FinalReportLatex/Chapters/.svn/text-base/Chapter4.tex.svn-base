\section{System Inputs}
Using the Figure \ref{fig:phantom} as the input phantom image, all the resulted reconstructed images were obtained with the image reconstruction algorithm as described in the chapter 2.  

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering

	\caption[Input Phantom Image.]{Shepp-Logan Phantom Image.}
	\label{fig:phantom}
\end{figure}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This software allows user to select the size of the image to be constructed in the run time. For a instance, 

\begin{verbatim}
Please input the image file number to be constructed: 
 1 - Shepp_Logan image with size 256 x 256
 2 - Shepp_Logan image with size 200 x 200
 3 - Shepp_Logan image with size 100 x 100
Your choice: 1
\end{verbatim}
As a system constrained, we always use square, even size gray-scale  PGM ASCII image format. 

Then the user has to input the required X-ray beam spacing that will be used to perform the radon transform. As a user guidance, this software system will provide minimum beam spacing if the user really wants to use the maximum number of beams for the reconstruction process.

As the next inputs, user has to select the type of the filter and the interpolation method that he/she wants to apply on the image. For a instance, 
\begin{verbatim}
Please input the type of the Filter: 
 1 : Shepp-Logan filter
 2 : Ram-Lak filter 
 3 : Low-pass cosine filter 
Your choice: 1
 
Please input the type of the Interporlator: 
 1 : Linear Interpolator
 2 : Nearest neighbor Interpolator 
Your choice: 1
\end{verbatim}

After that the system will generate and store the corresponding reconstructed image along with the Radon transform image and the convolution image inside the main folder. User can compare the output image with the original image stored inside the Phantom folder.   

\section{System Outputs}
According to the above input parameters, we can see that there are different possible combinations that user can use while executing the system. But here we are going to consider only few important test cases. 

\subsection{Test case 1:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Image size: $256 \times 256$
\item Beam spacing: 0.005 (i.e 363 beams)
\item Filter: Shepp-Logan
\item Interpolator:  Linear 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Radon Transformation}
The output of the radon transformation for the test case 1 is shown in the Figure \ref{fig:radont1}.  
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=80pt]{Figures/RadonTransform256.jpg}
	\caption[Radon transform of test case 1.]{Radon transform of test case 1.}
	\label{fig:radont1}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Convolution}
The output of the convolution (i.e. filtered Radon transformation) for the test case 1 is shown in the Figure \ref{fig:cont1}.  
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=80pt]{Figures/Convolution256.jpg}
	\caption[Convolution of test case 1.]{Convolution of test case 1.}
	\label{fig:cont1}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Back projection Transformation}
Corresponding reconstructed image is given by the Figure \ref{fig:t1}.  
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=150pt]{Figures/ReconstructedImage256.jpg}
	\caption[Test case 1 image.]{Test case1: Reconstructed phantom.}
	\label{fig:t1}
\end{figure}

The error related to the above reconstruction is given by the Figure \ref{fig:error}.  
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=230pt]{Figures/error.jpg}
	\caption[Reconstruction error image.]{Error of test case 1.}
	\label{fig:error}
\end{figure}

According to the error image \ref{fig:error}, we can conclude that the most of intensity errors occurred only near the edges of the phantom image.




\subsection{Test case 2:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Image size: $256 \times 256$
\item Beam spacing: 0.02 (i.e 121 beams)
\item Filter: Shepp-Logan
\item Interpolator:  Linear 
\end{itemize}
Corresponding reconstructed image is given by the Figure \ref{fig:t2}.  
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=150pt]{Figures/ReconstructedImage256t2.jpg}
	\caption[Test case 2 image.]{Test case2: Reconstructed phantom.}
	\label{fig:t2}
\end{figure}
According to the output image \ref{fig:t2}, we can see that the image become little blurred and distorted with respect to the Figure \ref{fig:t1}. This is because, for test case 2, we only used one third of beams compared to the test case 1. But this process is much faster than test case 1 process. 

Similar to this test cases, user can reconstruct image using different interpolators and filters provide by this system. 

\section{Performance Analysis }
From our experience the linear interpolator with the Shepp-logan filter or Low pass cosine filter will gives the best result of image reconstruction. Therefore in the following we will analysis the result using the linear interpolator and Shepp-logan filter setting for the code
